Configure the prometheus.yml file and run prometheus so that it scrapes the metrics being exposed by the elasticsearch exporter at port 9114.
---
Download prometheus using the wget command:
wget https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.51.1/prometheus-2.51.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz
Then extract the newly downloaded .tar.gz extension file:
tar xzf prometheus-2.51.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C ./
A folder titled prometheus-2.51.1.linux-amd64 will be visible under the root directory. Navigate within this folder and you will see few binaries and a prometheus.yml file.

Edit the prometheus.yml file and append the following to the scrape_configs section:

- job_name: "elasticsearch"
  static_configs:
  - targets: ["localhost:9114"]
Here, we have added a new job named elasticsearch to prometheus, to scrape metrics from port 9114 on our host.

Let's run the prometheus binary using our prometheus.yml file as the config:
nohup ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml &
Ensure to run the above command in the background.

By default, prometheus runs at port 9090. Using the View Port utility on the top right of this page, access this port.
Once on the Prometheus query page, navigate to Status -> Targets. Here, you can see two jobs in the UP state:
prometheus at port 9090
elasticsearch at port 9114
