Integrating Prometheus with EFK
Prometheus is an open-source monitoring solution for collecting and storing metrics. Integrating Prometheus with the EFK stack enables you to collect metrics about the performance and health of each component.
Prometheus allows per job scrape interval configuration that provides great flexibility in terms of which targets to scrape and how frequently.

Setting Up Prometheus
First, install Prometheus in your Kubernetes cluster. You can use the Prometheus Operator for easier management.

kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator/master/bundle.yaml
Configuring Prometheus to Monitor EFK Components
Elasticsearch Metrics: Use the elasticsearch-exporter to expose Elasticsearch metrics to Prometheus.
   apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
   kind: ServiceMonitor
   metadata:
     name: elasticsearch-exporter
     labels:
       team: backend
   spec:
     selector:
       matchLabels:
         app: elasticsearch-exporter
     endpoints:
     - port: http
Fluentd Metrics: Fluentd metrics can be exposed using the built-in Prometheus plugin.
   <source>
     @type prometheus
     port 24231
   </source>
Kibana Metrics: Kibana does not natively export Prometheus metrics, but you can use the kibana-prometheus-exporter plugin.
However, note that sensitive information and configuration data like secrets are not typically monitored using Prometheus.

ðŸ“½ Visualizing Metrics with Grafana
Grafana is a powerful tool for visualizing metrics. Once Prometheus is collecting metrics from the EFK stack, you can use Grafana to create dashboards.

Install Grafana:
   kubectl create -f grafana.yaml
where the yaml file would contain the required components for deployment:

---
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: grafana-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    app: grafana
  name: grafana
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: grafana
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: grafana
    spec:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 472
        supplementalGroups:
          - 0
      containers:
        - name: grafana
          image: grafana/grafana:latest
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          ports:
            - containerPort: 3000
              name: http-grafana
              protocol: TCP
          readinessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            httpGet:
              path: /robots.txt
              port: 3000
              scheme: HTTP
            initialDelaySeconds: 10
            periodSeconds: 30
            successThreshold: 1
            timeoutSeconds: 2
          livenessProbe:
            failureThreshold: 3
            initialDelaySeconds: 30
            periodSeconds: 10
            successThreshold: 1
            tcpSocket:
              port: 3000
            timeoutSeconds: 1
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 250m
              memory: 750Mi
          volumeMounts:
            - mountPath: /var/lib/grafana
              name: grafana-pv
      volumes:
        - name: grafana-pv
          persistentVolumeClaim:
            claimName: grafana-pvc
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: grafana
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 3000
      protocol: TCP
      targetPort: http-grafana
  selector:
    app: grafana
  sessionAffinity: None
  type: LoadBalancer

Configure Grafana DataSource:

Add Prometheus as a DataSource in Grafana to start creating dashboards for your EFK metrics.
Grafana supports multiple other datasources like Elasticserch, Graphite, InfluxDB, MySQL and even Google sheets.

A useful feature in Grafana is templating which allows creation of dynamic and reusable dashboards.

ðŸ•¬ Configuring Alerting
Alerting is crucial for being proactively notified about issues in your EFK stack before they escalate.

Alerting with Prometheus Alertmanager
Prometheus Alertmanager can manage alerts sent by Prometheus. Define alert rules based on EFK metrics.

Define Alert Rules:

For example, create an alert if Elasticsearch's heap usage is too high.

   groups:
   - name: elasticsearch-alerts
     rules:
     - alert: ElasticsearchHighHeapUsage
       expr: elasticsearch_jvm_memory_used_bytes / elasticsearch_jvm_memory_max_bytes > 0.9
       for: 5m
       labels:
         severity: critical
       annotations:
         summary: "High Heap Usage (instance {{ $labels.instance }})"
         description: "Elasticsearch node {{ $labels.node }} heap usage is above 90%."
Configure Alertmanager:

Set up Alertmanager to send notifications through email, Slack, or other channels when alerts are triggered.

   global:
     resolve_timeout: 5m
   route:
     receiver: 'slack-notifications'
   receivers:
   - name: 'slack-notifications'
     slack_configs:
     - channel: '#alerts'
