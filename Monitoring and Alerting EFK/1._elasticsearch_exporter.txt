Install and run the Elasticsearch exporter to scrape metrics from Elasticsearch and send them to Prometheus.


Download the exporter from here: https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter/releases

Note: Elasticsearch is accessible on port 30200.

Download the Elasticsearch exporter using the wget command:
wget https://github.com/prometheus-community/elasticsearch_exporter/releases/download/v1.7.0/elasticsearch_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
Then extract the newly downloaded .tar.gz extension file:
tar xzf elasticsearch_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz -C ./
A folder titled elasticsearch_exporter-1.7.0.linux-amd64 will be visible under the root directory. Navigate within this folder and you will see few files including a deployment.yml file and a binary file.

Let's proceed with the binary approach for running elasticsearch exporter. Run the following command:

nohup ./elasticsearch_exporter --es.uri="http://localhost:30200" &
Ensure to run the above command in the background.

By default, the exporter exposes metrics at port 9114. Curl the localhost at this port to verify if metrics are being exposed:
curl http://localhost:9114/metrics
Alternatively, you can also access the port by clicking on the three dots on the top right of this page, and selecting View Port.
