In Fluentd configuration, which directive is used to parse log files?
a.  <log> b. <format> c. <parser> d. <extract>

Answer:- <parse>
To parse log files, Fluentd typically uses plugins called "parsers." These parsers use the directive <parse> and are placed within the <source>, <match> or <filter> directives.

2. Which plugin is used by Fluentd to forward logs to Elasticsearch?
Ans:- Fluentd uses the fluent-plugin-elasticsearch plugin to forward logs to Elasticsearch. This plugin allows Fluentd to index and store log data in Elasticsearch, making it available for searching and analysis.

Which plugin type can be used in Fluentd to modify the data structure of a log message?
    Filter plugins in fluentd are used to parse, filter, and transform log messages as they pass through the Fluentd pipeline.

What is the default port number for Kibana?
The default port number for Kibana is 5601.

Which file format is used for Kibana dashboard exports and imports?
    Kibana uses a file format called NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON) for exporting and importing dashboards.
    NDJSON is a JSON format where each line represents a separate JSON object. This format is used to store multiple JSON objects in a single file, with each object separated by a newline character.

In Kibana, what is the role of the Index Pattern?
    An Index Pattern defines which Elasticsearch data to explore and visualize in Kibana.
    Creating an Index Pattern in Kibana means specifying a pattern that matches the names of the Elasticsearch indices.
    Once an index is created, Kibana analyzes the logs within it and identifies fields and their types.

How does Kibana connect to Elasticsearch?
    Kibana connects to Elasticsearch using the Elasticsearch REST API.
    When you configure Kibana to connect to an Elasticsearch cluster, you provide the URL of the Elasticsearch cluster's REST API endpoint.
    Kibana uses this endpoint to communicate with Elasticsearch for various operations.

How would you secure Kibana access in a production environment?
    Enabling Elasticsearch security features
    One of the ways to secure Kibana is to ensure that Elasticsearch is secured with authentication, authorization, and transport layer security (TLS/SSL) to protect the data accessed by Kibana.

Which Elasticsearch feature allows you to automate the creation of new indices when current ones meet specified conditions such as size or age?
a. Sharding  b. Index rollover c. index replicas d. Index templates
    index rollover
    The feature in Elasticsearch that allows you to automate the creation of new indices when current ones meet specified conditions such as size or age is called Index Rollover.

    This feature allows you to define conditions for when a new index should be created based on criteria such as size, age, or other factors, and then automatically "rollover" to a new index when those conditions are met.

What is the main benefit of utilizing custom Fluentd plugins?
    Enhancing log data with additional context.
    Custom plugins allow you to parse, filter, and enrich log data with additional information, making it more meaningful and useful for analysis and troubleshooting.

Which Elasticsearch index setting is critical for improving write performance in a log-heavy environment?
    a. Increasing the index buffer size
    b. increasing the number of replicas
    c. changing the refresh interval
    d. Decreasing the number of primary shards.
    Answer: Changing the refresh interval.
    The refresh interval controls how often the changes made to the index are made visible to search operations. In a log-heavy environment, setting a higher refresh interval can significantly improve write performance by reducing the frequency of index refreshes, which can be resource-intensive.

In the context of Fluentd, what is the purpose of a buffer plugin?
    a buffer plugin is used to temporarily store log data before it is processed and forwarded to its final destination.
    This prevents loss of logs due to target unavailability, or network issues.test
